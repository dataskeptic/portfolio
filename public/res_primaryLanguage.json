      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I am a Computer Science student, self-taught, and fluent in English, with practical experience in Artificial Intelligence and software development. My academic journey, combined with my curiosity, has led me to explore various technologies independently, always seeking to learn and apply new tools that can positively impact the world around us. I have solid skills in development with Next.js, Django, and Node.js, as well as advanced knowledge in AI techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I stay up to date with the latest tech trends because I believe that innovation and continuous learning are essential for success in the IT field. I am looking for an internship opportunity where I can apply and expand my skills, collaborate with an innovative team, and contribute to creating solutions that generate real impact. I am committed to my professional growth and excited to join a team that shares the vision of driving transformation through technology.",
